REScala Client Server Demo
==========================

This is a client server demo repo for REScala / Scala Loci / our Replicated Datatypes.

The code is extracted from a larger application, which is why there is some questionable amount of indirections in this codebase. May clean up at some point.

Run `sbt "run --static ../../target/resources/static"` to start the server. Connect at http://127.0.0.1:2358/
